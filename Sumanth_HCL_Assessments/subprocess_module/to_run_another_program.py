subprocess.run returns a subprocess.CompletedProcess object that is bound to result. The subprocess.CompletedProcess 
object includes details about the external programâ€™s exit code and its output. capture_output=True ensures that result.
stdout and result.stderr are filled in with the corresponding output from the external program. 
By default, result.stdout and result.stderr are bound as bytes, but the text=True keyword argument instructs 
Python to instead decode the bytes into strings.
