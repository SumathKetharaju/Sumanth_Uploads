Portable --> Portable means we can take the code on any malayalam hardware and it will run, why Python is portable because that
Python code get converted into byte, that means our source code(a.py file) is not directly run at hardware rather than
this code will be converted into a compile code with extension .pyc file (compiled code) and this compiled code is an
intermediate instruction and this intermediate instruction is known as byte code and byte code is assembly language and
this instructions are directly map into mam the hardware until and unless they will not interpreted so here the interpreter
will come into the picture and the of this interpreter is to interpret the byte code to the target machine, so the
reason behind this is all the source code is first converted to assembly code that is byte code and the byte code are
platform independent they are independent on the hardware and madam operating system and to run this byte code only the target
machine that is virtual machine to understand that byte code. So, byte code is going to be converting the machine code
by the reason is there is python virtual machine and that virtual dad machine has an interpreter and that interpreter is
converting the byte code to machine and thatâ€™s how our code is portable it consists of byte code not machine code.
