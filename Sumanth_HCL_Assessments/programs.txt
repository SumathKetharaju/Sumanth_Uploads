Printing patterns

Let’s say you have a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it. (Use List Comprehension and Lambda expression).

Take a list, say for example this one:

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Extras:

Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.

Write this in one line of Python.

Ask the user for a nuxmber and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

Lata has been assigned a task to write a program in Python to maintain the details of a student such as roll, name,
address and email. The implementation methodology shall be object oriented. Each student shall be initialized through
the constructor. There should be a common method that will print the details of each student on the screen. As a friend
help her in writing the solution of program.



Create the Employee class with following constraints:

The class should have the attributes, id, name, department, age and email.

The class must have a method, named setEmployee () to initialize the attributes of Employee class.

All the variables must be declared as private

The id shall be generated automatically for each employee. For example, when first object of an employee is created,
then the id shall be 1 and similarly the id for second employee shall be 2 and so on.
