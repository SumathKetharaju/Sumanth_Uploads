Hospital Mangement

1. Admission
Age: whether these functions working or not
name:
issue:
2. Diagnosis
3. report handling
4. treatment
5. Dischage with no payment due
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Test suite/ Test script/Test module = multiple test cases
test scenario/ scenario/test case /sub test = individual test functions


test data = the arguments/values we are passing to testing function(INPUT)

positive test data: data which makes the test pass
negative test data: data which makes the test fail

# positive testing: making sure function working fine with expected/postive inputs
# negative testing : making sure function NOT working fine with UNexpected/naegative inputs

# unit testing: Checking each function is behaving/returning expected data/output for valid input.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Integration testing:
combining each developed scripts together and checking end-to-end scenarios.

Avinash = addition   = def test_addition
Bharath = substraction  = def test_operation
Visu = Mulitplication = def test_multiplication
Mahesh = division = = def test_operation; substraction method overrides

end-to-end testing: extensive testing on every component

Grey


black testing: we are not interested about internal implementaion , just checking whether test case is working or not.
Eg: Booking IRCTC ticket, it's not working from 11.30PM-12PM

white testing: we are interested about internal implementaion , just checking whether test case is working or not.
Eg: Booking IRCTC ticket, it's not working from 11.30PM-12PM, because IRCTC server upgrade will happen in that time. So no service avaialble for
end user.

Regression testing:
Testing for every change we committed to make sure test working with current version. If fails, we need to investigate on delta/differnce.

Dec 12, 5000 lines , test pass; Version 1
Dec 13, 5012 lines , test pass; version 2
Dec 14, 5082 lines , test fail; version 3

smoke test: Checking very very basic functionality/components

eg: checking website is launching or not.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Customer acceptance testing: 95% of test cases should pass.

Alpha(A) testing: Acceptance testing
Developer testing when work is completed to make sure whether it can be delivered to client or not.

Beta testing: After alpha testing and delivery, end user/client will check whether it is working fine or not.
EG: Avinash windows delivery to client
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


System testing: When we checked and finalized that if it is working fine in one system , to make sue the stability we will
execute same in another system to make sure the stability.
Eg: python program should run on windows and linux as well.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

stress testing :unfavorable conditions to the system and check how they perform in those conditions.
The intention is to find highest bearable workload for the given system.
Eg: copying 250 GB file from one location to another location using python program.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Performance testing : used to test performance parameters like speed and effectiveness of the program.

eg: jmeter, iometer , upload and download speed for wifi

Object oriented testing: pytest

Sanity: Sanity test will intended for most important and basic test checking.
Whenever we have new release to qualify that, we will run sanity test.
