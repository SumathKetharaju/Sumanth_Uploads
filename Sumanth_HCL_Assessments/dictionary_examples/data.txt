We can use any text editing software to write a Python script file.

We just need to save it with the .py extension. But using an IDE can make our life a lot easier. IDE is a piece of
software that provides useful features like code hinting, syntax highlighting and checking, file explorers, etc. to the
 programmer for application development.

By the way, when you install Python, an IDE named IDLE is also installed. You can use it to run Python on your computer.
 It's a decent IDE for beginners.

When you open IDLE, an interactive Python Shell is opened.
