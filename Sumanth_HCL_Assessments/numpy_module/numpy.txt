numpy -->
numpy is one of the fundamental package for scientific computing
its primary characteristic is directly allows data to be represented in the form of n dimensional arrays and then supplies a number of features
which allow us to transform and manipulate those arrays
since it provide such an elementary at crucial platform numpy serves as a builtin block for a wide variety of python based data science libraries
this include other data structure packages such as pandas and also data visualization tools like matplot lib and machine learning frameworks
like cycleton

complex operations such as indexing, slicing, universal functions and reshaping arrays

introduction to numpy -->
numpy express the data in the form of arrays

array creation -->

indexing and slicing operations on numpy array -->
the ellipses is used to denote the rest of the array
reshapping arrays -->
the differnce between ravel and flatten is that flatten belongs to array onject and can only used by numpy arrays
the ravel function belongs to numpy library and can be applied to any object which can be successfully passed
